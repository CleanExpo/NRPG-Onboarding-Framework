### Moisture Measurement Standards

#### Acceptable Moisture Levels (Australian Climate Zones)
| Material Type | Acceptable Level | Wet Level | Saturated Level |
|---------------|------------------|-----------|------------------|
| Softwood | <15% | 18-25% | >28% |
| Hardwood | <12% | 15-20% | >25% |
| Gypsum Drywall | <1% | 1.5-2.5% | >3% |
| Concrete | <4% | 6-10% | >12% |
| Masonry | <6% | 8-12% | >15% |

#### Climate Zone Considerations
- **Tropical (Zone 1):** Higher ambient humidity affects drying times
- **Hot Humid Summer (Zone 2):** Seasonal variation in drying capacity
- **Warm Humid Summer (Zone 3):** Moderate humidity impact
- **Hot Dry Summer (Zone 4):** Lower humidity aids drying
- **Warm Temperate (Zone 5):** Seasonal drying variations
- **Mild Temperate (Zone 6):** Cool, humid conditions slow drying
- **Cool Temperate (Zone 7):** Extended drying times required
- **Alpine (Zone 8):** Cold temperatures significantly impact drying

### Equipment Specifications

#### Extraction Equipment Capacity Guidelines
| Room Size | Extractor CFM | Duration Estimate |
|-----------|---------------|-------------------|
