3. Maintain consistent meter positioning
4. Apply uniform contact pressure
5. Record readings systematically

Coverage Strategy:
- Start with reference/dry areas
- Progress systematically across surface
- Overlap scanning paths slightly
- Note boundary areas carefully
- Mark suspicious readings for verification

INTERPRETATION
Reading Scales:
- Relative moisture indication only
- Compare to established dry references
- Look for gradient patterns
- Identify boundary transitions

Pattern Recognition:
- Uniform moisture distribution
- Linear flow patterns
- Radial spreading patterns
- Isolated moisture pockets

VALIDATION REQUIREMENTS

- Overlapping coverage areas
- Multiple angles for complex areas

INTERPRETATION
Temperature Patterns:
- Evaporation cooling indicates moisture
- Thermal bridges show structural elements
- Air leaks create temperature gradients
- Moisture patterns show flow paths

colour Scale Analysis:
- Cooler areas (blue/purple) = potential moisture
- Warmer areas (red/yellow) = dry or heated
- Gradient patterns = moisture migration
- Sharp transitions = material boundaries

DOCUMENTATION
