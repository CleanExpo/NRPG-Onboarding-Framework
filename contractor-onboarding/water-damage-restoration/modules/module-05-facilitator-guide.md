## Session Structure and Timing

### **Part 1: Psychrometric Foundations and Climate Applications (60 minutes)**

#### Opening and Technical Introduction (15 minutes)

**Facilitator Opening Strategy:**
Begin with a real-world scenario demonstrating the critical importance of psychrometric understanding:

"Last month, a Brisbane restoration company struggled with a drying project that should have taken 5 days but stretched to 3 weeks. The client was furious, insurance was threatening non-payment, and the contractor lost $15,000. The problem? They didn't understand how Brisbane's high humidity affects dehumidifier efficiency."

**Learning Engagement Questions:**
- "How many of you have experienced unexpectedly slow drying progress?"
- "What role do you think outdoor weather plays in indoor drying success?"
- "Who can explain why the same equipment performs differently in different cities?"

**Technical Foundation Building:**
- Introduce psychrometrics as the "science behind successful drying"
