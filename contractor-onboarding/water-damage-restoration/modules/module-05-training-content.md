### Drying Science Principles

**Moisture Movement Physics:**
Understanding how moisture moves through materials and air systems is fundamental to effective drying system design.

### Equipment Sizing and Capacity Calculations

**Moisture Load Assessment:**
Professional equipment sizing requires accurate calculation of total moisture requiring removal from the affected environment.

**Calculation Methodology:**

**Step 1: Material Moisture Assessment**
```
Moisture Load (Litres) = Affected Area (m²) × Material Factor × Saturation Level

Material Factors (Litres per m²):
- Carpet and pad: 8-12 litres/m²
- Hardwood flooring: 4-8 litres/m²
- Concrete slab: 10-20 litres/m²
- Gypsum board: 2-4 litres/m²
- Insulation: 15-25 litres/m²
```

**Step 2: Environmental Moisture Load**
```
Air Volume (m³) = Length × Width × Height
Current Moisture = Air Volume × Current Humidity Content
Target Moisture = Air Volume × Target Humidity Content
Environmental Load = Current Moisture - Target Moisture
```

**Step 3: Equipment Capacity Selection**
```
Required Capacity (L/day) = Total Moisture Load ÷ Target Drying Time (days)
Equipment Size = Required Capacity × Safety Factor (1.2-1.5)
```

**Australian Specific Calculations:**

**Brisbane Climate Example:**
- Outdoor Conditions: 28°C, 75% RH
- Indoor Target: 22°C, 45% RH
- 200m² affected area with carpet and concrete
- **Calculation:** Material load (200m² × 10L/m²) + Environmental load = 2,200L
- **Equipment Required:** 110L/day capacity × 1.3 safety factor = 145L/day minimum

**Melbourne Winter Example:**
- Outdoor Conditions: 12°C, 85% RH
- Indoor Target: 20°C, 40% RH (heated)
- 150m² affected area with timber flooring
- **Calculation:** Material load (150m² × 6L/m²) + Environmental load = 1,100L
- **Equipment Required:** Desiccant dehumidifier due to low temperature conditions
