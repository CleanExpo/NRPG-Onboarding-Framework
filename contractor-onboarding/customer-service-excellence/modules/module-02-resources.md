## Insurance Communication Guide

### Initial Insurance Discussion Framework
"Most restoration work is covered by homeowner's insurance. Here's how the process typically works:

1. **Claim Filing:** If you haven't already, you'll need to file a claim with your insurance company
2. **Adjuster Visit:** Your insurance will send an adjuster to assess the damage
3. **Scope Agreement:** We work with the adjuster to agree on necessary repairs
4. **Payment Process:** Insurance typically pays us directly after deductible

I'll coordinate with your adjuster throughout the process and keep you informed of any coverage questions."

### Payment Process Explanation
"Here's what you can expect regarding payment:

**Your Responsibility:**
- Insurance deductible (paid when work begins)
- Any upgrades beyond policy coverage

**Insurance Covers:**
- Restoration to pre-loss condition
- Necessary temporary repairs
- Contents cleaning/replacement (if covered)

**Our Process:**
- We bill insurance directly when possible
- Provide detailed documentation
- Handle all paperwork and communication"
