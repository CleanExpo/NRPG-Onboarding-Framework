## Resource 4: Customer Insurance Education Guide

### Coverage Explanation Scripts

#### Deductible/Excess Explanation
**Customer Question:** "Why do I have to pay anything if I have insurance?"

**Professional Response:**
"Your deductible [or excess] is part of your insurance policy design. It's the amount you pay toward any claim, and your insurance covers the costs above that amount. Think of it as your contribution to the claim.

For example, if your damage costs $10,000 to repair and your deductible is $500, you pay $500 and insurance pays $9,500. This keeps your premiums lower because you share in the cost of claims.

The deductible applies to each separate incident, so if you have another claim later, the deductible would apply again."

#### Coverage Limitations Explanation
**Customer Question:** "Why isn't this damage covered? I pay premiums every month."

**Professional Response:**
"Insurance policies are contracts that specify what is and isn't covered. Your policy covers sudden, accidental damage but excludes gradual deterioration or maintenance issues.

This isn't about avoiding payment - it's about the type of incident that caused the damage. Insurance is designed to cover unexpected events, not normal wear and tear or maintenance issues.

Let me review your policy with you so you understand exactly what is covered, and I can help you identify what might be covered vs. what would be your responsibility."

#### Timeline Expectations
**Customer Question:** "Why is this taking so long? Can't they just approve it?"

**Professional Response:**
"Insurance companies have a legal obligation to investigate claims thoroughly to protect both you and other policyholders. This ensures legitimate claims are paid fairly and helps keep premiums reasonable for everyone.

The typical timeline is:
- Initial response: 24-48 hours
- Assessment: 5-10 business days
- Decision: 10-15 business days

Your claim is [ahead of/on track with/behind] this typical timeline. The adjuster needs to [specific current activity], which typically takes [timeframe].

I'll keep you updated on progress and let you know immediately if anything changes."

### Claims Process Education Framework

#### Step-by-Step Process Explanation
**Phase 1: Claim Notification**
"When damage occurs, you contact your insurance company immediately. They create a claim file and assign a claim number. This starts the official process."

**Phase 2: Assessment**
"An adjuster visits to assess the damage, determine the cause, and evaluate coverage. This includes taking photos, measurements, and gathering information about what happened."

**Phase 3: Investigation**
"The insurance company reviews all information to determine coverage and the extent of damage that will be covered under your policy."

**Phase 4: Approval and Work**
"Once coverage is confirmed, work can begin. The insurance company may pay contractors directly or reimburse you for approved expenses."

**Phase 5: Completion and Settlement**
"After work is completed and inspected, final payment is made and the claim is closed."
