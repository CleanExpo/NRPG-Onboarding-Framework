## Exercise 1: Personal Pressure Response Assessment
**Duration:** 15 minutes
**Participants:** Individual work, then small groups
**Materials:** Self-assessment forms, stress response charts

### Objective:
Develop self-awareness of personal pressure triggers and physical/emotional responses to build foundation for management techniques.

### Part A: Trigger Identification (8 minutes)

#### Self-Assessment Questions:
Participants complete individually and honestly:

1. **Customer Behaviour Triggers:**
   - What customer actions make you feel most defensive?
   - Which types of complaints affect you personally?
   - When do you feel your expertise is being questioned?

2. **Situational Triggers:**
   - What work circumstances increase your stress level?
   - Which time pressures affect your communication quality?
   - What technical problems during calls create anxiety?

3. **Physical Response Awareness:**
   - Where do you feel tension in your body when stressed?
   - How does your voice change under pressure?
   - What happens to your breathing during difficult conversations?

4. **Communication Changes:**
   - Do you speak faster or slower when stressed?
   - How does your listening quality change under pressure?
   - What words or phrases do you overuse when anxious?

### Part B: Small Group Sharing (7 minutes)

**Process:**
- Groups of 3-4 participants
- Share 1-2 triggers from each category
- Identify common patterns across group
- Discuss successful strategies currently used

**Facilitator Notes:**
- Encourage honesty without judgment

**Original:** "This is taking way too long!"
**Poor Response:** "These things take time."
**Better Response:** "I can see this timeline feels overwhelming. Let me explain exactly what's happening and when you can expect each step to be completed."

**Original:** "I want to speak to someone who actually knows something!"
**Poor Response:** "I am qualified to help you."
**Better Response:** "I want to make sure you get the expert attention you need. Let me either address your technical questions directly or connect you with our specialist who can provide the detailed information you're looking for."

### Practice Application:
- **Round 1:** Partner delivers escalation statement
- **Round 2:** Participant responds using de-escalation language
- **Round 3:** Observer provides feedback on language effectiveness
