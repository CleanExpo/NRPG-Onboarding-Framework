## Facilitator Preparation Notes

### Creating Psychological Safety
**Critical for this module:** Participants must feel safe to share vulnerabilities and practice challenging scenarios without judgment.

**Opening Strategies:**
- Acknowledge that everyone experiences pressure - it's normal and professional
- Share appropriate personal example of pressure management learning
- Establish confidentiality agreements for sharing during exercises
- Normalise the learning process - competence comes through practice

### Managing Emotional Content
**Participant Emotional Responses:**
- Some may become emotional discussing pressure triggers
- Others may minimise their stress responses
- Competitive participants might resist admitting vulnerability
- Introverts may hesitate to share in group settings

**Facilitator Responses:**
- Validate all responses without judgment
- Provide options for private vs. group sharing
- Have tissue available and acknowledge emotions as normal
- Redirect focus to skill-building rather than personal therapy

## Session Timeline and Detailed Facilitation

### Opening Segment (25 minutes)

#### Welcome and Pressure Normalisation (10 minutes)
**Facilitator Script:**
"Welcome to Communication Under Pressure. Before we begin formal introductions, I want to acknowledge something: every single person in this room has experienced pressure during customer interactions. It's not a weakness - it's human. Today we're going to build practical skills for managing these situations professionally and effectively."

**Interactive Opening:**
"Let's do a quick show of hands - how many of you have ever felt your heart rate increase during a challenging customer call?"
*[Expect most hands]*
"Perfect - you're in the right place. Today we'll learn to use that physiological response productively rather than being overwhelmed by it."

#### Module Overview and Ground Rules (8 minutes)
**Learning Objectives Emphasis:**
- Stress the practical, skill-based nature of training
- Highlight immediate applicability to work situations
- Assure participants that pressure management is learnable

**Ground Rules for Emotional Safety:**
- What's shared here stays here
- No judgment of personal pressure responses
- Right to pass on sharing personal examples
- Focus on skill development, not personal therapy

#### Introductions with Pressure Awareness (7 minutes)
**Structured Introduction:**
"Please share your name, role, and one word that describes how pressure affects your communication style - for example, 'rushed,' 'careful,' 'defensive,' or 'withdrawn.'"

**Facilitator Notes:**
- Record responses on flip chart for reference
- Look for patterns across group
- Note individuals who may need extra support
- Use responses to tailor examples throughout session
