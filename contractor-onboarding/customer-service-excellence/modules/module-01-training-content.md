## Introduction (5 minutes)

### Welcome to Customer Psychology in Crisis
When disaster strikes, your customers are experiencing one of the most stressful periods of their lives. Their home—their sanctuary—has been damaged, and they're facing uncertainty, loss, and disruption. As a disaster recovery professional, understanding the psychological state of your customers is crucial for providing exceptional service and achieving successful outcomes.

**Key Insight:** People in crisis don't just need technical expertise; they need emotional support, clear communication, and trustworthy guidance.

## Lesson 1: Emotional States During Disasters (12 minutes)

### The Disaster Response Cycle
When disaster strikes, customers typically experience a predictable emotional journey:

#### 1. **Shock and Disbelief (0-24 hours)**
- **Characteristics:** Numbness, confusion, difficulty processing information
- **What you'll observe:** Customers may seem detached or ask the same questions repeatedly
- **Your response:** Speak slowly, repeat important information, be patient with processing time

#### 2. **Acute Stress Response (24-72 hours)**
- **Characteristics:** Anxiety, overwhelm, emotional volatility
- **What you'll observe:** Rapid speech, difficulty focusing, emotional outbursts
- **Your response:** Provide clear, simple instructions; acknowledge their stress as normal

#### 3. **Reality Setting In (3-7 days)**
- **Characteristics:** Grief, anger, frustration with the situation
- **What you'll observe:** Questions about timeline, costs, insurance coverage
- **Your response:** Provide realistic timelines, clear documentation, frequent updates

#### 4. **Adjustment Phase (1-4 weeks)**
- **Characteristics:** Acceptance, focus on solutions, future planning
- **What you'll observe:** More rational decision-making, detailed questions
- **Your response:** Involve them in planning, provide detailed explanations

### Common Emotional Reactions

**Fear and Anxiety:**
- Fear of further damage
- Anxiety about costs and insurance
- Worry about health and safety
- *Response Strategy:* Provide factual information, explain safety measures

**Anger and Frustration:**
- Anger at the situation or insurance companies
- Frustration with timelines
- Blame toward contractors or adjusters
- *Response Strategy:* Don't take it personally, acknowledge their feelings, redirect to solutions

**Grief and Loss:**
- Mourning for damaged possessions
- Sense of violated personal space
- Loss of routine and normalcy
- *Response Strategy:* Show empathy, validate their feelings, focus on restoration

### Practical Application Exercise
**Scenario Practice:** You arrive at a water-damaged home. The customer keeps asking, "How did this happen? This can't be real." 

**Your response should include:**
1. Acknowledge their shock: "I understand this is overwhelming."
2. Provide immediate reassurance: "We're here to help, and we'll get through this together."
3. Explain the immediate next steps clearly and simply.

## Lesson 2: Stress Response and Decision Making (10 minutes)

### How Stress Affects the Brain

#### The Stress Response System
When people experience stress, their brain activates the "fight, flight, or freeze" response:

**Fight Response:**
- Manifests as: Argumentative behavior, challenging your expertise
- Impact on decisions: May make hasty decisions or refuse recommendations
- Your approach: Stay calm, provide evidence, give them control where possible

**Flight Response:**
- Manifests as: Wanting to leave the property, avoiding decisions
- Impact on decisions: May delay necessary actions or avoid phone calls
- Your approach: Create safe spaces for discussion, follow up consistently

**Freeze Response:**
- Manifests as: Inability to make decisions, appearing overwhelmed
- Impact on decisions: May agree to everything or nothing at all
- Your approach: Break decisions into smaller steps, provide gentle guidance

#### Cognitive Impacts of Stress

**Reduced Working Memory:**
- Can only process 2-3 pieces of information at once
- *Implication:* Keep explanations simple and sequential

**Impaired Executive Function:**
- Difficulty weighing pros and cons
- *Implication:* Provide clear recommendations with rationale

**Heightened Emotional Processing:**
- Emotions override logical thinking
- *Implication:* Address emotional needs before presenting technical information

### Decision-Making Support Strategies

1. **Chunk Information:** Present decisions in small, manageable pieces
2. **Use Visual Aids:** Photos, diagrams, written summaries
3. **Provide Time:** Don't rush unless safety is involved
4. **Offer Options:** Present 2-3 clear choices rather than unlimited options
5. **Document Decisions:** Written summaries help with memory issues

### Case Study: The Overwhelmed Homeowner
*Background:* Mrs. Johnson's kitchen has sustained severe water damage from a burst pipe. She keeps changing her mind about repair versus replacement options.

**Stress indicators observed:**
- Repeating the same concerns
- Unable to focus on contractor explanations
- Becoming emotional during discussions

**Effective intervention approach:**
1. Schedule a follow-up meeting after initial shock subsides
2. Prepare a simple comparison chart
3. Break the decision into phases
4. Provide references to previous similar projects

## Lesson 3: Building Trust in Crisis Situations (12 minutes)

### The Trust Equation in Crisis
**Trust = (Credibility + Reliability + Intimacy) ÷ Self-Orientation**

#### Building Credibility

**Clear Communication:**

### Building Trust Across Cultures

**Cultural Sensitivity Principles:**

## Lesson 4: Cultural Sensitivity Considerations (6 minutes)

### Understanding Cultural Diversity in Crisis Response

#### Key Cultural Dimensions

**Communication Patterns:**
- **High-Context Cultures:** Meaning derived from context, non-verbal cues important
- **Low-Context Cultures:** Direct communication, explicit information preferred
- *Application:* Adjust your communication style based on customer responses and preferences

**Authority and Hierarchy:**
- Some cultures emphasize respect for professionals and experts
- Others prefer collaborative decision-making
- *Application:* Gauge customer preference for directive vs. collaborative approaches

**Family and Community:**
- Individual vs. collective decision-making
- Extended family involvement in major decisions
- *Application:* Ask who should be included in important conversations

#### Practical Cultural Sensitivity

**Universal Respect Practices:**
1. **Active Inquiry:** "What's the best way for me to work with your family during this process?"
2. **Flexible Scheduling:** Accommodate religious observances and family obligations
3. **Communication Adaptation:** Adjust formality level based on customer preference
4. **Space Awareness:** Respect cultural norms about entering homes and personal space

**Language Considerations:**
- Speak slowly and clearly
- Avoid idioms and colloquialisms
- Use visual aids when helpful
- Confirm understanding regularly
- Arrange interpreters when needed

**Religious and Cultural Practices:**
- Be aware of dietary restrictions during long work days
- Respect religious items and spaces in the home
- Accommodate prayer times and religious observances
- Ask about cultural customs related to home repairs

### Avoiding Cultural Missteps

**Common Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Making assumptions based on appearance or names
- Using overly familiar language or behavior
- Ignoring family dynamics and decision-making processes
- Dismissing concerns that seem cultural rather than practical

**Recovery Strategies:**
If you make a cultural mistake:
1. **Acknowledge:** "I realize I may have misunderstood your preferences."
2. **Apologize:** Simple, sincere apology without over-explaining
3. **Ask:** "What would work better for your family?"
4. **Adapt:** Implement changes immediately
