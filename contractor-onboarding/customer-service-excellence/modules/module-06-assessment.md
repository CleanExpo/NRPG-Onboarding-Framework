## Part 2: Insurance Scenario Analysis (25 points)

### Scenario A: Water Damage Coverage Dispute (5 points)

**Situation:** The Peterson family's Paddington home suffered water damage when a bathroom pipe burst while they were on holiday. They discovered the damage after returning from a two-week overseas trip. Water had been running for an unknown period, causing extensive damage to hardwood floors, kitchen cabinets, and downstairs carpet. The adjuster is questioning coverage, suggesting the damage may be from "gradual deterioration" rather than a sudden burst, and wants to exclude hardwood floor replacement from the claim.

**Your Task:** Outline your professional approach to supporting the customer while working with the adjuster to resolve the coverage dispute.

**Assessment Criteria:**
- Technical evidence gathering (2 points)
- Professional adjuster collaboration (1 point)
- Customer advocacy within professional bounds (1 point)
- Documentation strategy (1 point)

**Sample Strong Response:**
"I would focus on gathering technical evidence to support the sudden incident claim while maintaining professional collaboration with the adjuster.

**Technical Evidence Strategy:**
- Document water damage patterns that indicate sudden vs. gradual damage
- Take moisture readings in affected and unaffected areas
- Photograph pipe failure point showing sudden burst characteristics
- Document timeline evidence (neighbour observations, utility meter readings if accessible)

**Professional Adjuster Collaboration:**
Present findings objectively: 'Based on technical assessment, the damage pattern and moisture readings are consistent with a sudden pipe failure. Here's the documentation supporting this conclusion.'

**Customer Advocacy:**
Support the customer with professional expertise while explaining the adjuster's investigation process: 'I'm providing all technical evidence to support your claim, and here's what the adjuster needs to make their coverage determination.'

**Documentation Strategy:**
Comprehensive photo documentation, technical moisture and damage assessments, written report with professional findings and industry standard references supporting sudden damage conclusion."

### Scenario B: Commercial Property Multi-Party Claim (5 points)

**Situation:** A fire in a Fortitude Valley restaurant kitchen has caused smoke damage throughout the building. The restaurant (tenant) has contents insurance, the building owner has building insurance, and the property manager is coordinating with both. The building insurer wants to repaint the entire building for consistency, the restaurant's insurer only wants to cover damaged areas, and the property manager is concerned about other tenants. Each party has different adjusters and expectations.

**Your Task:** Demonstrate professional coordination of this multi-party insurance situation.

**Assessment Criteria:**
- Multi-stakeholder coordination (2 points)
- Professional communication with multiple adjusters (1 point)
- Scope management across different policies (1 point)

**Multi-Stakeholder Coordination:**
- Schedule joint assessment with both adjusters and property manager
- Prepare comprehensive scope separating building vs. contents work
- Facilitate communication between all parties about overlapping coverage
- Document agreements and responsibilities clearly

**Professional Communication:**
- Present technical findings to both adjusters simultaneously for consistency
- Explain restoration requirements that affect both building and contents
- Provide industry standards for smoke damage restoration
- Maintain objective professional stance with all parties

**Scope Management:**
- Clearly separate building restoration (building insurer) from contents cleaning/replacement (contents insurer)
- Identify common areas requiring coordination between policies
- Address consistency requirements professionally with technical justification
- Provide separate quotes for different coverage areas

**Conflict Resolution:**
When insurers disagree, focus on technical requirements: 'Industry standards require comprehensive smoke damage restoration to prevent long-term issues. Here's how we can achieve this while respecting both policies' coverage.'"

### Scenario C: Gradual vs. Sudden Damage Challenge (5 points)

**Situation:** Mrs. Chen's Toowong home shows water damage in the bathroom and adjacent bedroom. The adjuster believes this is gradual damage from a slow leak over months, pointing to some mould growth and wood rot. The customer insists a pipe "just burst last week" and is frustrated that the adjuster won't approve the claim. You need to determine the actual cause and support the appropriate claim outcome.

**Your Task:** Demonstrate professional investigation and appropriate customer/adjuster communication.

**Assessment Criteria:**
- Technical investigation approach (2 points)
- Objective professional findings (1 point)
- Appropriate customer communication (1 point)
- Professional relationship maintenance (1 point)

**Sample Strong Response:**
"I would conduct objective technical investigation and communicate findings professionally to all parties.

**Technical Investigation:**
- Comprehensive moisture assessment in affected and surrounding areas
- Detailed examination of pipe failure point and damage patterns
- Assessment of mould growth patterns and timeline indicators
- Documentation of material damage progression and causation

**Objective Professional Findings:**
Present findings factually regardless of preferred outcome: 'Based on technical assessment, the evidence indicates [sudden incident/gradual deterioration] because [specific technical indicators]. Here's the documentation supporting this conclusion.'

**Customer Communication:**
If gradual damage: 'I understand this is disappointing news. The technical evidence shows gradual damage over time, which isn't typically covered. However, let me explain what options you have for addressing the repairs.'

If sudden damage: 'The evidence supports your position about a sudden incident. I'm documenting this thoroughly to support your claim with the adjuster.'

**Professional Relationship Maintenance:**
Maintain positive relationships regardless of findings: 'My role is to provide objective technical assessment. This benefits everyone by ensuring accurate claim handling based on actual conditions.'"

### Scenario D: Code Compliance and Coverage Dispute (5 points)

**Situation:** Storm damage to a 1980s Brisbane home requires electrical work that doesn't meet current building codes. The adjuster wants to restore to "pre-damage condition" with old electrical standards, but current codes require upgrades for safety. The customer can't afford the upgrade costs and wants insurance to cover full code compliance.

**Your Task:** Navigate the code compliance vs. insurance coverage challenge professionally.

**Assessment Criteria:**
- Code requirement explanation (1 point)
- Insurance coverage clarification (1 point)
- Customer options presentation (2 points)
- Professional solution development (1 point)

**Sample Strong Response:**
"I would clearly explain the requirements and coverage while presenting all available options.

**Code Requirement Explanation:**
'Current building codes require electrical upgrades for safety when doing this type of restoration work. This isn't optional - it's a legal requirement for the work to be completed properly.'

**Insurance Coverage Clarification:**
'Insurance typically covers restoration to pre-damage condition. Code upgrades are usually only covered when they're required to complete the restoration work safely and legally.'

**Customer Options Presentation:**
1. **Pursue code upgrade coverage:** 'We can document why code compliance is necessary for proper restoration and present this to your adjuster.'
2. **Separate the work:** 'Complete insurance restoration work and handle code upgrades as separate project with clear cost separation.'
3. **Alternative approaches:** 'Explore if phased restoration approach allows code compliance within coverage.'
4. **Professional advocacy:** 'Engage a public adjuster or insurance specialist if coverage dispute persists.'

**Professional Solution Development:**
'Let me work with your adjuster to explore if the code requirements can be considered part of proper restoration rather than betterment. I'll provide technical documentation showing why safe restoration requires code compliance.'"

### Scenario E: Settlement vs. Repair Decision (5 points)

**Situation:** After flood damage to a Moorooka home, the adjuster offers a cash settlement for $45,000 instead of repairing, saying it's more cost-effective. The customer wants the work done properly but worries the settlement won't cover quality restoration. They ask for your advice on whether to accept the settlement or insist on repairs.

**Your Task:** Provide appropriate professional guidance within your role boundaries.

**Assessment Criteria:**
- Professional boundary awareness (1 point)
- Technical cost assessment (2 points)
- Customer decision support (1 point)
- Insurance process guidance (1 point)

**Sample Strong Response:**
"I would provide technical information to support their decision while staying within professional boundaries.

**Professional Boundary Awareness:**
'I can't advise whether to accept the settlement as that's an insurance decision beyond my professional scope. However, I can provide technical information about restoration costs and quality to help you make an informed decision.'

**Technical Cost Assessment:**
'Based on the damage assessment, proper restoration including materials, labour, and code compliance would cost approximately $X. Here's the detailed breakdown showing what's included in quality restoration work. The settlement amount would [cover/not cover] complete professional restoration.'

**Customer Decision Support:**
'Here are the factors to consider: Settlement gives you control over contractor selection and work quality, but you're responsible for cost overruns. Insurance-managed repairs provide oversight but less control over contractor selection.'

**Insurance Process Guidance:**
'You have the right to negotiate the settlement amount if you believe it's inadequate. You can provide additional quotes or technical assessments supporting higher costs. You can also request a review by a senior adjuster or engage a public adjuster for advocacy.'"
