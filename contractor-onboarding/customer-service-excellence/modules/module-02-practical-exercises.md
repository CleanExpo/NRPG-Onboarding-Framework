# CSE-M02 Practical Exercises: First Contact Excellence

## Exercise 1: Emergency Call Role-Play (20 minutes)

### Setup
- **Participants:** Work in pairs (one contractor, one customer)
- **Materials:** Emergency scenario cards, SCOPE method worksheet, timer
- **Duration:** 8 minutes role-play + 4 minutes debrief + 8 minutes group discussion

### Emergency Scenario Cards

**Scenario A: Water Emergency**
You're calling about a burst pipe in your basement. Water is actively flowing, and you're panicking. You don't know how to turn off the water. Your basement has your home office and family photos. Keep asking "What do I do?" and sound increasingly stressed.

**Scenario B: Fire Damage**
You had a kitchen fire last night. The fire department left 3 hours ago. There's smoke damage throughout the house and water damage from firefighting efforts. You're exhausted and overwhelmed. You keep saying you don't know where to start.

**Scenario C: Storm Damage**
A tree fell on your roof during last night's storm. It's still raining, and water is coming into your upstairs bedrooms. You're concerned about structural safety. You have young children and need to know if it's safe to stay in the house.

### Contractor Guidelines - SCOPE Method Practice
Use the SCOPE framework to gather information systematically:
- **S**afety: Address immediate safety concerns first
- **C**ause: Understand what caused the damage
- **O**ccurred: Determine when the incident happened
- **P**roperty: Assess property type and damage extent
- **E**mergency: Establish urgency level and required response

### Debrief Questions
1. Did the contractor address safety first?
2. Was the SCOPE method used effectively?
3. How well did the contractor manage the customer's emotional state?
4. Were realistic timelines and expectations set?
5. What could be improved in the response?

## Exercise 2: Communication Channel Selection (12 minutes)

### Part A: Channel Decision Making (8 minutes)
**Instructions:** For each communication need, select the most appropriate channel and explain why.

**Scenario 1:** You need to provide a detailed restoration timeline with multiple phases and coordination requirements.
*Best Channel:* _______________
*Reason:* _______________

**Scenario 2:** You're running 30 minutes late for an on-site appointment.
*Best Channel:* _______________
*Reason:* _______________

**Scenario 3:** Customer is emotional and confused about the insurance process after receiving adjuster report.
*Best Channel:* _______________
*Reason:* _______________

**Scenario 4:** Quick confirmation that customer will be available tomorrow morning for equipment delivery.
*Best Channel:* _______________
*Reason:* _______________

**Scenario 5:** Customer needs detailed explanation of water categories and why Category 3 water requires different treatment.
*Best Channel:* _______________
*Reason:* _______________

### Part B: Multi-Channel Strategy Practice (4 minutes)
**Group Activity:** Design a communication plan for a complex water damage restoration
- **Day 1:** Initial contact and emergency response
- **Day 2-3:** Assessment results and insurance coordination  
- **Week 1:** Project execution updates
- **Project completion:** Final walkthrough and documentation

For each phase, specify: Channel, frequency, content type, responsible person

## Exercise 3: Script Practice and Adaptation (15 minutes)

### Professional Script Development
**Instructions:** Work in small groups to improve these customer service scripts

**Original Script (Poor Example):**
"Hi, this is John from ABC Restoration. I got your message about some water damage. I can probably come out sometime this week to take a look. It shouldn't be too big of a deal. Most of these things are pretty straightforward. Give me a call back when you get a chance."

**Improvement Areas to Address:**
- Lacks urgency and professionalism
- Uses weak language ("probably," "shouldn't be")
- Doesn't address customer's emotional state
- No clear next steps or timeline
- Missing safety assessment

### Script Improvement Activity (10 minutes)
**Group Task:** Rewrite the script to include:
1. Professional greeting with empathy
2. Safety priority assessment
3. Clear action steps and timeline
4. Professional language choices
5. Specific next steps

### Practice Delivery (5 minutes)
- Each group presents their improved script
- Other participants provide feedback on:
  - Tone and professionalism
  - Completeness of information
  - Customer-focused language
  - Clear action items

---

## Exercise 4: Expectation Setting Simulation (10 minutes)

### The Realistic Timeline Challenge
**Scenario:** You're dealing with a customer who has unrealistic expectations about restoration timeframes.

**Customer Background (for role-play partner):**
- Severe water damage from second-floor bathroom leak
- Damage to kitchen, living room, and basement
- Customer expects restoration completed in "2-3 days"
- Has important family event in one week
- Doesn't understand insurance approval process

### Contractor Objectives
Practice the expectation management framework:
1. **Acknowledge** their urgency and importance of the event
2. **Educate** about restoration process phases
3. **Provide** realistic timeline with buffer time
4. **Offer** solutions to minimize impact
5. **Document** agreed-upon expectations

### Practice Structure
- 5 minutes role-play conversation
- 3 minutes observer feedback
- 2 minutes group discussion on effective techniques

### Observer Checklist
- ☐ Used empathy to acknowledge customer concerns
- ☐ Explained process phases clearly
- ☐ Provided realistic timeline with buffer
- ☐ Discussed factors that could affect timeline
- ☐ Offered alternative solutions or accommodations
- ☐ Confirmed understanding and documented expectations

## Exercise 5: Documentation Practice (8 minutes)

### Real-Time Information Capture
**Instructions:** Listen to emergency call scenario (audio or live reading) and complete documentation using provided form.

**Call Scenario Script (for facilitator to read):**
"This is Sarah Martinez calling from 425 Oak Street. I just discovered water damage in my downstairs family room and kitchen. I think it's coming from the upstairs bathroom - there was a problem with the toilet this morning. This happened around 8 AM, about 4 hours ago. The water has spread across most of the hardwood floors downstairs. I have three young children, and we're supposed to have a birthday party here this weekend. My insurance company is Mutual Benefits Insurance, policy number MB-456789. I need someone here as soon as possible. My cell phone is 555-0123, and my husband can be reached at 555-0124."

### Documentation Form Fields to Complete:
- Customer name and contact information
- Property address and description
- Incident details (cause, time, extent)
- Insurance information
- Urgency factors
- Customer priorities/concerns
- Immediate action items
- Response timeline commitment

### Accuracy Check (3 minutes)
- Compare completed forms in small groups
- Identify any missed information
- Discuss strategies for capturing information during emotional calls

## Exercise 6: Professional Language Workshop (10 minutes)

### Power Words vs. Weak Words Exercise
**Instructions:** Replace weak or problematic language with professional alternatives.

**Weak Language Examples:**
1. "I'll try to get someone out there today"
2. "This should only take about a week"
3. "We might be able to work with your insurance"
4. "I think this will be covered"
5. "Hopefully we can start tomorrow"
6. "This shouldn't be too expensive"
7. "We'll try our best to meet your timeline"
8. "I guess we could do it that way"

**Professional Alternatives Challenge:**
- Work in pairs to rewrite each statement
- Use definitive, confident language
- Focus on customer benefits
- Eliminate uncertainty words

### Empathy Phrase Development
**Activity:** Create professional empathy responses for these customer statements:

**Customer:** "This is a disaster! My whole house is ruined!"
**Your response:** ________________________________

**Customer:** "I can't afford to be out of my house for weeks!"
**Your response:** ________________________________

**Customer:** "I don't understand all this insurance stuff!"
**Your response:** ________________________________

**Customer:** "The last contractor never called me back!"
**Your response:** ________________________________
