What is the "Fight, Flight, or Freeze" response in professional communication?
A) A customer service training model
B) Primitive brain responses that can interfere with effective communication ✓

Which breathing technique is recommended for managing pressure during customer calls?
A) 3-3-3 breathing
B) 4-4-4 breathing ✓
C) 5-5-5 breathing
D) 6-6-6 breathing

**Explanation:** The 4-4-4 breathing technique (inhale 4, hold 4, exhale 4) is specifically designed for discrete use during professional interactions.

### Question 3
What does the "C" in the CALM protocol stand for?
A) Control yourself
B) Centre yourself ✓
C) Call supervisor
D) Challenge the customer

**Explanation:** Centre yourself means taking a deliberate breath, adjusting posture, and reminding yourself of your competence and resources.

### Question 4
During which phase of the escalation cycle is intervention most effective?
A) Phase 1-2: Early intervention ✓
B) Phase 3: Crisis peak
C) Phase 4: Recovery
D) Phase 5: Resolution

**Explanation:** Early intervention during the trigger event and building tension phases prevents escalation to crisis levels.

### Question 5
Which phrase should be AVOIDED during de-escalation?
A) "I understand your frustration"
B) "That makes sense"
C) "Calm down" ✓
D) "Let's work together"

**Explanation:** "Calm down" invalidates the customer's feelings and often increases agitation rather than reducing it.

What is the 5-4-3-2-1 grounding technique used for?
A) Counting down to hang up on difficult customers
B) Sensory grounding to restore calm focus ✓
C) Setting appointment times
D) Prioritising emergency calls

**Explanation:** This technique uses sensory awareness to ground yourself in the present moment and reduce pressure response.

How should you adjust your speech when feeling stressed during a call?
A) Speak faster to get through quickly
B) Speak 10-15% slower than normal ✓
C) Match the customer's pace exactly
D) Speak as quietly as possible

### Question 10
When managing multi-stakeholder pressure, what should you address first?

### Question 11
Which physical posture helps manage pressure during calls?
A) Leaning forward aggressively
B) Feet flat on floor, back straight, shoulders relaxed ✓

### Question 12
What is "pressure as information" referring to?
A) Recording call data
B) High-pressure situations reveal what matters most to customers ✓
C) Creating pressure reports
D) Measuring stress levels

**Explanation:** Pressure situations provide valuable insight into customer priorities and concerns, helping tailor responses.

A) Ask them directly about their preferences
B) Observe how they prefer to receive information and what concerns they express first ✓
C) Assume based on age or gender
D) Use the same approach for everyone

**Explanation:** Quick observation of information preferences and priority concerns reveals communication style for adaptive response.

### Question 14

## Part 2: Scenario Analysis (15 points)

### Scenario A: High-Pressure Insurance Conflict (5 points)

**Situation:** Sarah's Brisbane home suffered significant water damage three days ago. The insurance adjuster has just informed her that certain items she thought were covered are not included in her policy. She calls you extremely upset, saying she's being "ripped off" and demanding you start work immediately regardless of insurance approval. She's threatening to "find someone who actually cares about customers" if you don't begin today.

**Your Task:** Write your response demonstrating pressure management and de-escalation techniques. Your response should show:
- Recognition of escalation phase
- Application of CALM protocol
- Appropriate de-escalation language
- Professional boundary management

**Assessment Criteria:**
- Pressure management techniques applied (2 points)
- De-escalation language used effectively (2 points)
- Professional boundaries maintained while showing empathy (1 point)

**Sample Strong Response:**
"Sarah, I can hear how incredibly frustrated and disappointed you are about this insurance situation [Acknowledge]. This feels like you're being treated unfairly when you're already dealing with so much [Empathy].

Let me take a moment to understand exactly what the adjuster told you so I can see how we might work through this together [Pressure pause/Centre].

While I can't start full restoration work without proper approvals - which actually protects you from potential out-of-pocket costs [Boundary with explanation] - let me explain what emergency mitigation work we can do today that's typically pre-approved, and then I'll personally contact your adjuster to advocate for your coverage [Solution focus].

I'm not going anywhere, Sarah. We're going to solve this together [Reassurance]."

### Scenario B: Multi-Stakeholder Commercial Pressure (5 points)

**Situation:** A fire damaged the kitchen of a busy restaurant in Fortitude Valley. The owner (Marcus) is losing $8,000 per day, the property manager (Janet) is fielding complaints from other tenants about smoke odour, and the insurance adjuster (David) is requesting additional documentation before approving the scope. All three are calling you demanding immediate action and blaming the delays on the others. You have a three-way conference call scheduled in 30 minutes.

**Your Task:** Outline your communication strategy for managing this multi-stakeholder pressure situation.

**Assessment Criteria:**
- Multi-stakeholder awareness demonstrated (2 points)
- Pressure management strategy outlined (2 points)
- Conflict resolution approach planned (1 point)

**Sample Strong Response:**
"For this three-way call, I'll use a structured approach to address all perspectives:

1. **Opening:** Acknowledge each party's concerns specifically - Marcus's financial losses, Janet's tenant issues, David's documentation requirements [Multi-stakeholder awareness]

2. **Common Ground:** Emphasise shared goal of complete, properly approved restoration that protects everyone's interests [Pressure management]

3. **Information Gathering:** Systematically review what documentation David needs, what emergency measures can address Janet's tenant concerns, and what timeline Marcus needs for business planning [Structured approach]

4. **Solution Framework:** Present phased approach - immediate odour mitigation for tenants, expedited documentation for insurance, realistic timeline for full restoration [Conflict resolution]

5. **Communication Plan:** Establish daily updates and direct contact protocols so no one feels left out of the loop [Ongoing management]

This approach addresses each person's primary pressure while maintaining focus on professional, compliant solutions."

### Scenario C: Emotional Family Crisis (5 points)

**Situation:** The Thompson family's Toowong home was severely damaged by a fallen tree during a storm. Grandmother Rose (78) has been displaced from her bedroom and is confused and distressed. Mother Jennifer is trying to manage three school-age children, work responsibilities, and her mother's care while living in a hotel. Father David is traveling for work and calling frequently but can't return immediately. Jennifer calls you crying, saying she "can't handle this anymore" and needs "someone to just fix everything."

**Your Task:** Demonstrate communication techniques for managing emotional pressure while providing practical support.

**Assessment Criteria:**
- Emotional pressure recognition (2 points)
- Support strategy without over-promising (2 points)
- Practical next steps provided (1 point)

**Sample Strong Response:**
"Jennifer, I can hear in your voice how overwhelmed you are right now [Emotional recognition]. Managing your mum, the children, work, and this displacement all at once - anyone would feel this way [Validation].

Let's break this down into manageable pieces so you're not carrying everything at once [Pressure reduction strategy].

First, for Rose's immediate comfort, we can arrange priority restoration of one bedroom so she has familiar surroundings within 48 hours [Practical immediate solution].

Second, for the children's routine, I'll coordinate with the school about any documentation they need and work around pick-up times [Family support consideration].

Third, I'll create a daily update email that goes to both you and David so you're not the only one tracking everything [Communication burden reduction].

You don't have to handle this alone, Jennifer. My job is to manage the restoration details so you can focus on caring for your family [Reassurance with role clarity]."
