## Introduction (5 minutes)

### The Critical First Impression
The first contact with a disaster-affected customer often determines the success of the entire restoration project. Research shows that customers form lasting impressions within the first 30 seconds of interaction. This module focuses on making that first contact exceptional, professional, and trust-building.

**Key Insight:** You never get a second chance to make a first impression, especially when customers are in crisis mode.

## Lesson 1: Emergency Response Protocols (15 minutes)

### The First Call Framework

#### 1. **Immediate Response Standards (Within 15 minutes)**
- Answer calls within 3 rings or return missed calls within 15 minutes
- Have customer information system accessible
- Maintain calm, professional tone regardless of customer's emotional state
- Use active listening to gather essential information quickly

#### 2. **Essential Information Gathering**
**The SCOPE Method:**
- **S**afety: Are there immediate safety concerns?
- **C**ause: What caused the damage?
- **O**ccurred: When did it happen?
- **P**roperty: What type of property and extent of damage?
- **E**mergency: What immediate action is needed?

#### 3. **Initial Safety Assessment**
**Critical Questions:**
- "Is anyone injured or in immediate danger?"
- "Is the electricity still on in the affected area?"
- "Is there any structural damage you can see?"
- "Do you smell gas or any chemical odors?"
- "Is the water still flowing/leaking?"

**Safety Priority Script:**
"Mr. Johnson, before we discuss anything else, I need to make sure you and your family are safe. Can you tell me..."

### Documentation During Emergency Calls

#### Required Information Capture
1. **Contact Details:** Name, address, phone numbers (primary and alternate)
2. **Property Information:** Type, age, construction details
3. **Damage Details:** Source, extent, affected areas
4. **Insurance Information:** Company, policy number, adjuster contact
5. **Urgency Level:** Immediate safety issues vs. standard response
6. **Access Information:** Keys, security codes, pets, access restrictions

#### Digital Documentation Tools
- Use CRM systems to capture information in real-time
- Create photo/video capabilities for customer self-documentation
- Set up automated follow-up reminders
- Generate initial service tickets immediately

### Response Time Commitments

#### Service Level Standards
- **Emergency Response:** On-site within 2-4 hours
- **Standard Response:** On-site within 24 hours
- **Initial Assessment:** Complete within first site visit
- **Preliminary Report:** Within 4 hours of assessment

**Commitment Language:**
"Based on what you've described, I'm classifying this as [emergency/standard]. I can have our assessment team on-site by [specific time]. Does this work with your schedule?"

## Lesson 2: Setting Realistic Expectations (15 minutes)

### The Expectation Management Framework

#### 1. **Process Overview Explanation**
**The Three-Phase Communication:**

**Phase 1: Assessment (Day 1)**
"Today, we'll thoroughly assess the damage, take photos, and create an initial plan. You'll receive a written summary within 4 hours."

**Phase 2: Planning (Days 2-3)**
"We'll work with your insurance company to finalize the scope and get approval. This typically takes 1-2 business days."

**Phase 3: Execution (Days 4+)**
"Once approved, we'll begin the restoration work. I'll give you a detailed timeline once we complete the assessment."

#### 2. **Timeline Setting Best Practices**

**Use Buffer Time:**
- Add 20-30% buffer to all estimates
- Example: "This typically takes 3-4 days, but I want to allow 5 days to ensure quality work"

**Milestone Communication:**
- Break project into clear phases with completion dates
- Set communication checkpoints every 2-3 days
- Provide both optimistic and realistic scenarios

**Weather and External Factor Disclaimers:**
"These timelines assume normal weather conditions and standard insurance approval processes. I'll keep you updated if anything changes."

#### 3. **Cost and Insurance Discussions**

**Initial Cost Framework:**
"The preliminary assessment will help determine the scope and cost. Most of our work is covered by insurance, and we'll work directly with your adjuster to streamline the process."

**Payment Process Explanation:**
"Here's how the payment process typically works: [explain deductible, insurance direct pay, any upfront costs]. I'll provide all details in writing after our assessment."

**Avoid Early Cost Estimates:**
"I don't want to give you an inaccurate number over the phone. Let me complete the assessment first, then I can provide you with detailed, accurate pricing."

### Managing Customer Anxiety

#### Reassurance Techniques
- Acknowledge their stress: "I understand this is overwhelming"
- Provide structure: "Here's exactly what happens next"
- Offer control: "What questions can I answer for you?"
- Share experience: "We handle situations like this regularly and will guide you through each step"

#### Question Handling
**Common Customer Questions and Responses:**

**"How long will I be out of my home?"**
*Response:* "That depends on the extent of damage, which we'll determine in our assessment. For similar situations, it's typically [range]. I'll have a better answer for you after we complete the evaluation."

**"Will insurance cover everything?"**
*Response:* "I'll work directly with your insurance company to maximize coverage. Every policy is different, so let me review your specific situation and keep you informed throughout the process."

**"Are you available 24/7?"**
*Response:* "For emergencies, yes. For routine questions and updates, our office hours are [hours]. I'll provide you with both my direct number and our emergency line."

## Lesson 3: Professional Communication Scripts (15 minutes)

### Initial Contact Scripts

#### Inbound Emergency Call Script

"Thank you for calling [Company Name], this is [Your Name]. I understand you have water/fire damage at your property. Before we discuss anything else, I need to make sure everyone is safe. Is anyone injured or in immediate danger?

[Wait for response]

Good. Now, can you tell me what happened and when it occurred?

[Listen actively, take notes]

Based on what you've described, I want to get someone out to assess the situation right away. I can have our emergency response team on-site by [time]. Does this work for your schedule?

In the meantime, here's what you should do to prevent further damage... [provide immediate advice]

I'm going to email you my direct contact information and a summary of our conversation. What's the best email address for you?"
```

#### Outbound Follow-Up Call Script
```
"Hello Mr./Ms. [Name], this is [Your Name] from [Company Name]. I'm calling to follow up on the water damage at your [property type] on [street]. How are you doing today?

I wanted to confirm our appointment for [time/date] and let you know what to expect. Our assessment will take approximately [time] and I'll need access to [areas]. 

Do you have any questions before I arrive? Is there anything specific you'd like me to focus on during the assessment?

```
