2. **Scenario Analysis** (2 scenarios - 10 points)
3. **Practical Application** (5 points)

## Part 1: Knowledge Check (15 points)
*Select the best answer for each question*

### Question 1
What is the maximum acceptable timeframe for returning an emergency call?
A) 30 minutes
B) 15 minutes ✓
C) 1 hour
D) Within the same business day

**Explanation:** Emergency calls must be returned within 15 minutes to meet industry standards and customer expectations during crisis situations.

### Question 2
Which component is NOT part of the SCOPE method for information gathering?
A) Safety concerns
B) Cause of damage
C) Customer credit history ✓
D) Property type and extent of damage

**Explanation:** The SCOPE method focuses on immediate operational needs: Safety, Cause, Occurred, Property, Emergency. Credit history is handled separately during the insurance process.

### Question 3
When giving timeline estimates to customers, best practice is to:
A) Give the shortest possible timeframe to impress them
B) Add 20-30% buffer time to estimates ✓
C) Promise completion in half the expected time
D) Avoid giving any timeframes until work begins

**Explanation:** Adding buffer time prevents customer disappointment and allows for unexpected delays while maintaining realistic expectations.

### Question 4
During an emergency call, the FIRST priority should always be:
A) Gathering insurance information
B) Ensuring everyone's safety ✓
C) Scheduling an assessment appointment
D) Estimating repair costs

**Explanation:** Safety is the paramount concern in any emergency response situation before any other considerations.

### Question 5
Which phrase should be avoided when communicating with customers?
A) "I'll coordinate with your insurance company"
B) "I'll try to call your adjuster" ✓
C) "We'll begin assessment immediately"

**Explanation:** "Try" suggests uncertainty and lack of commitment. Use definitive language that demonstrates confidence and professionalism.

### Question 6
The recommended response time for emergency on-site visits is:
A) Within 24 hours
B) Within 2-4 hours ✓
C) Within 48 hours
D) Next business day

**Explanation:** Emergency situations require rapid response within 2-4 hours to prevent further damage and provide immediate customer reassurance.

### Question 7
When a customer asks "Will insurance cover everything?", the best response is:
A) "Yes, insurance always covers disaster damage"
B) "No, insurance never covers the full amount"
C) "I'll work directly with your insurance company to maximise coverage" ✓
D) "That's not my area of expertise"

**Explanation:** This response shows expertise while avoiding promises about specific coverage that vary by policy.

### Question 8
Text messaging should be used for:
A) Complex insurance explanations
B) Initial emergency contact
C) Appointment confirmations ✓
D) Emotional support during crisis

**Explanation:** Text is appropriate for brief, factual communications like appointment confirmations, whilst phone calls are better for complex or emotional situations.

### Question 9
How much buffer should be added to timeline estimates?
A) 10-15%
B) 20-30% ✓
C) 50-60%
D) No buffer needed

**Explanation:** 20-30% buffer provides realistic expectations whilst accommodating common delays without being unnecessarily conservative.

### Question 10
According to Australian consumer law, contractors must:
A) Provide services within 24 hours
B) Give written estimates for work over $1,000 ✓
C) Accept insurance payment only
D) Guarantee all work for 10 years

**Explanation:** Under Australian Consumer Law, written quotes are required for services exceeding $1,000 to protect consumer rights.

### Question 11
The primary purpose of the initial call documentation is to:
A) Create a marketing database
B) Ensure safety and gather essential project information ✓
C) Determine customer creditworthiness

### Question 12
When explaining costs over the phone, the best approach is to:
A) Give exact dollar amounts immediately
B) Avoid cost discussions entirely until assessment ✓
C) Provide rough estimates to help budgeting

**Explanation:** Without seeing the damage, cost estimates are inaccurate and potentially misleading. Wait for proper assessment.

### Question 13
Professional language should emphasise:
A) Technical complexity to show expertise
B) Uncertainty to manage expectations
C) Confidence and clarity ✓
D) Casual friendliness to reduce stress

**Explanation:** Professional communication balances confidence with clarity whilst maintaining appropriate empathy for the customer's situation.

### Question 14
The best way to handle customer anxiety during first contact is to:
A) Minimise their concerns
B) Provide structure and acknowledge their stress ✓
C) Share stories of worse situations
D) Transfer them to a manager immediately

### Question 15
Documentation during emergency calls should include all EXCEPT:

B) Damage details and insurance information
C) Customer's personal family history ✓
D) Access information and urgency level

**Explanation:** Focus on information relevant to the restoration project. Personal family history is not necessary for professional service delivery.

## Part 2: Scenario Analysis (10 points)

### Scenario A: Emergency Water Damage Call (5 points)

**Situation:** You receive a call at 9:30 PM from Sarah Mitchell. She's crying and says her kitchen sink pipe burst whilst she was at work. She came home to find water throughout her ground floor. She has no idea how long it's been leaking, and she's afraid to turn on any lights because she's heard water and electricity don't mix.

**Your Task:** Write your opening response to Sarah's call, including your first four questions and immediate advice. Your response should demonstrate:
- Safety prioritisation
- Professional empathy
- Information gathering technique
- Immediate action guidance

**Assessment Criteria:**
- Safety addressed immediately (2 points)
- Appropriate empathy and tone (1 point)
- Systematic information gathering (1 point)
- Clear immediate guidance (1 point)

**Sample Strong Response:**
"Sarah, this is [Name] from [Company]. First, I need to make sure you're safe. Please don't turn on any lights or electrical switches in the affected area, and step away from any standing water immediately. Are you somewhere safe right now where you can talk?

I understand this is incredibly stressful coming home to this situation. Let me help you through this step by step.

First, can you tell me - is anyone injured or in immediate danger? Second, do you know where your main water shut-off valve is located? Third, can you smell any gas or see any obvious structural damage? Fourth, are you able to access your electrical meter box safely from outside?

Here's what I need you to do right now while we talk..."

### Scenario B: Difficult Customer Situation (5 points)

**Situation:** Michael Pham calls for the third time today. His commercial property suffered storm damage 48 hours ago. He's angry because his insurance adjuster hasn't responded, his tenants are threatening to leave, and he feels like nothing is happening fast enough. He's demanding someone come out "right now" and starts the work before insurance approval, saying he'll "find another company" if you can't help immediately.

**Your Task:** Write your response that addresses his concerns whilst maintaining professional boundaries and realistic expectations.

**Assessment Criteria:**
- Acknowledges customer frustration appropriately (1 point)
- Maintains professional boundaries (2 points)
- Provides realistic solutions and alternatives (1 point)
- Demonstrates understanding of insurance process (1 point)

**Sample Strong Response:**
"Michael, I completely understand your frustration - 48 hours feels like forever when your business is affected. Your tenants' concerns are valid, and I appreciate the pressure you're under.

Here's what I can do immediately: I can have our emergency team on-site within 2 hours to assess the damage and implement emergency mitigation measures to prevent further damage. This includes tarping, water extraction, and securing the property - work that's typically pre-approved by insurers for emergency situations.

However, I must be upfront about the insurance process. Starting full restoration work without adjuster approval could jeopardise your coverage. What I can do is contact your adjuster myself and escalate the urgency of your situation whilst we handle the emergency mitigation.

Would you like me to arrange immediate emergency mitigation and personally follow up with your insurance company today?"
