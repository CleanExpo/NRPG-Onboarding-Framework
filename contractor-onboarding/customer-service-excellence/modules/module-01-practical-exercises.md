# CSE-M01 Practical Exercises: Understanding Customer Psychology in Crisis

## Exercise 1: Disaster Response Cycle Role-Play (15 minutes)

### Setup
- **Participants:** Work in pairs (one contractor, one customer)
- **Materials:** Scenario cards, observation sheets
- **Duration:** 5 minutes role-play + 5 minutes debrief + 5 minutes group discussion

### Scenario Cards

**Customer Scenario A (Shock and Disbelief):**
You discovered your basement flooded this morning. You keep saying "This can't be happening" and "How did this happen?" You feel numb and have difficulty focusing on what the contractor is saying. Ask the same questions multiple times.

**Customer Scenario B (Acute Stress Response):**
Your kitchen was damaged in a fire yesterday. You're talking rapidly, jumping between topics (insurance, work, kids, repairs). You're clearly anxious and struggling to prioritize what needs to happen first.

**Customer Scenario C (Reality Setting In):**
It's been 5 days since storm damage affected your home. You're frustrated and starting to ask detailed questions about timelines, costs, and insurance coverage. You're concerned about how long this will take and what it will cost.

### Contractor Guidelines
- Identify which phase your customer is in
- Adjust your communication style accordingly
- Practice appropriate responses for each phase

### Debrief Questions
1. Which emotional phase was your customer in?
2. What specific behaviors indicated this phase?
3. How did you adjust your communication approach?
4. What worked well? What would you do differently?

### Part A: Stress Response Identification (5 minutes)

**Scenario 2:** Customer agrees to everything you suggest without asking questions, seems overwhelmed, and appears unable to make any decisions.

*Response Type:* _______________

**Scenario 4:** Customer becomes argumentative about the scope of work and insists their way is the only correct approach.
*Response Type:* _______________

### Part B: Intervention Practice (7 minutes)
**Instructions:** For each stress response, practice appropriate intervention techniques with a partner.

**Fight Response Practice:**
- Partner 1: Act challenging and argumentative
- Partner 2: Practice staying calm, providing evidence, giving control where appropriate
- Switch roles and practice

**Freeze Response Practice:**

## Exercise 3: Trust-Building Conversation Practice (10 minutes)

### The Trust Challenge
**Scenario:** You're meeting a customer whose previous contractor left the job incomplete and they're now suspicious of all contractors.

### Customer Background (for role-play partner):
- Previous contractor took money and disappeared
- Feeling betrayed and mistrustful
- Worried about being taken advantage of again
- Needs reassurance but is guarded

### Trust-Building Objectives
Practice incorporating all elements of the Trust Equation:

1. **Credibility:** Demonstrate competence without overwhelming
2. **Reliability:** Make specific, realistic commitments
3. **Intimacy:** Show empathy while maintaining professional boundaries
4. **Low Self-Orientation:** Focus on customer needs, not your company's benefits

### Practice Structure
- 5 minutes role-play
- 3 minutes feedback from observer
- 2 minutes group debrief on most effective trust-building techniques

### Observer Checklist
- ☐ Acknowledged customer's previous negative experience
- ☐ Demonstrated competence appropriately
- ☐ Made specific, realistic commitments
- ☐ Showed empathy without being overly familiar
- ☐ Asked about customer's concerns before presenting solutions
- ☐ Used "you" language more than "I/we" language

## Exercise 4: Cultural Sensitivity Scenarios (8 minutes)

### Scenario-Based Learning
**Instructions:** Work in small groups. Each group gets one scenario to discuss and present solutions.

**Scenario 1: Language Barriers**
The homeowner's English is limited, and they seem frustrated when you explain technical restoration processes. Their teenage daughter is translating, but you notice some information might be getting lost in translation.

**Discussion Points:**
- What immediate steps can you take?
- How do you ensure accurate communication?
- Who should you direct your conversation toward?

**Scenario 2: Religious Considerations**
You arrive at a home during a religious holiday. The family seems uncomfortable with your presence but doesn't want to delay the restoration work. You notice religious items throughout the damaged areas.

**Discussion Points:**
- How do you show respect for their religious observance?
- What questions should you ask about working around religious items?
- How do you balance urgency with cultural sensitivity?

**Scenario 3: Family Decision-Making**
The homeowner keeps saying they need to "discuss with family" before making any decisions, even about urgent safety issues. Multiple family members want to be involved in every decision.

**Discussion Points:**
- How do you respect collective decision-making while addressing urgent needs?
- What's the appropriate way to include all family members?
- How do you handle time-sensitive decisions?

### Group Presentations (5 minutes)
Each group presents their scenario and solution approach to the class.

## Take-Home Practice Assignment

### Customer Psychology Journal
For the next week, keep a brief journal of customer interactions:

**Daily Entries Should Include:**
1. **Emotional Phase Observed:** Which disaster response phase was the customer in?
2. **Stress Response:** Did you observe fight, flight, or freeze behaviors?
3. **Cultural Considerations:** Were there any cultural factors that influenced the interaction?
4. **Trust-Building:** What did you do to build trust? What was the customer's response?
5. **Reflection:** What would you do differently next time?

**Format Example:**
```
Date: [Date]
Customer: [Initials only]
Phase: Reality Setting In
Stress Response: Mild fight response - questioning timeline
Cultural Notes: Preferred family meeting for major decisions
Trust Building: Provided written timeline, references from similar projects
Reflection: Should have asked about family involvement earlier
```

### Submission Guidelines
- Keep entries brief (2-3 sentences per section)
- Focus on learning, not customer details
- Protect customer privacy (no names or identifying information)
- Submit at next training session for discussion
