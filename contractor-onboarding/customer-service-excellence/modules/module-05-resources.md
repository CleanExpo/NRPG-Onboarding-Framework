## Resource 5: Professional Boundary Setting Scripts

### Inappropriate Request Response Templates

#### **Off-the-Books Work Requests**
**Customer Request:** "Could you do some work without involving insurance to save us money?"

**Professional Response:**
"I understand you're looking to minimize costs, which makes complete sense. However, I need to work within insurance requirements and professional guidelines to protect both of us. Undocumented work could actually put you at financial risk if issues arise later. Let me review your policy coverage thoroughly to see if there are legitimate ways to maximize your benefits while staying within proper procedures."

#### **Scope Creep Pressure**
**Customer Request:** "Since you're already here, can't you just fix this other issue too?"

**Professional Response:**
"I'm happy to help with additional work, and I want to make sure we handle it properly. This type of additional work requires a separate assessment and documentation to ensure it's done correctly and covered appropriately. Let me provide you with a separate estimate for this additional work so you can make an informed decision about timing and cost."

#### **Timeline Pressure Beyond Professional Limits**
**Customer Request:** "I don't care about permits or inspections, just get it done quickly."

**Professional Response:**
"I understand the urgency of your situation, and I want to help you get back to normal as quickly as possible. These requirements actually protect you by ensuring the work is done safely and meets building standards. If we skip these steps, it could create bigger problems later. Let me show you how we can expedite the proper process to get you the fastest timeline while maintaining safety and quality standards."

#### **Inappropriate Personal Relationship Requests**
**Customer Request:** "You seem like such a nice person. Would you like to join us for dinner sometime?"

**Professional Response:**
"Thank you for the kind invitation - that's very thoughtful of you. I maintain professional relationships with all my customers to ensure I can provide the best possible service. I'm always available to discuss your restoration needs during business hours, and I'm committed to making sure you're completely satisfied with our professional relationship."
