## Session Timeline and Detailed Facilitation

### Opening Segment (20 minutes)

#### Welcome and Introductions (10 minutes)
**Facilitator Script:**
"Good morning, and welcome to First Contact Excellence. My name is [Name], and I'll be your facilitator today. Before we begin, let's go around the room. Please share your name, your current role, and one word that describes how you feel when you receive an emergency call from a stressed customer."

**Facilitation Notes:**
- Note responses about feeling words - address common concerns during session
- Watch for experienced vs. new participants - adjust examples accordingly
- Create inclusive environment by acknowledging all responses positively

#### Module Overview and Objectives (10 minutes)
**Key Points to Emphasise:**
- First contact sets tone for entire customer relationship

- Skills are measurable and improvable
- Real impact on business outcomes (retention, referrals, reputation)

**Interactive Element:**
"Show of hands: How many of you have ever changed companies based on poor customer service?"
*[Expect most hands up]*
"That's exactly why this training matters - we want to be the company customers choose, not the one they leave."

### Core Training Delivery (120 minutes)

#### Lesson 1: Emergency Response Protocols (30 minutes)

**Opening Activity (5 minutes):**
Display scenario: "Water pipe burst, customer calling at 11 PM, very upset"
Ask: "What's your first question?" Collect responses on flip chart.

**Content Delivery (20 minutes):**
- Present SCOPE method with interactive explanation
- Have participants memorise acronym through repetition
- Demonstrate response time standards with real examples
- Show sample documentation forms

**Facilitation Tips:**
- **Visual Learners:** Use flowchart of SCOPE method on flip chart
- **Auditory Learners:** Have participants repeat SCOPE elements aloud
- **Kinesthetic Learners:** Let them handle and fill out documentation forms

**Check for Understanding (5 minutes):**
Quick quiz: "If customer says 'my ceiling is dripping but I don't know from what,' which SCOPE element does this address?"
*[Answer: Cause - need to investigate source]*

#### Lesson 2: Setting Realistic Expectations (30 minutes)

**Opening Discussion (8 minutes):**
"Think of a time someone gave you an unrealistic timeline. How did it make you feel when they missed it?"
Collect emotional responses: frustrated, betrayed, angry, distrustful.

**Content Delivery (17 minutes):**
- Three-phase communication framework with examples
- Buffer time calculation exercises
- Cost discussion best practices
- Weather and external factor considerations

**Interactive Element (5 minutes):**
Pair activity: "One person thinks of a home repair timeline. Add 20% buffer. Partner guesses original timeline." Demonstrates how buffers feel reasonable when explained properly.

**Common Facilitation Challenges:**
- **"But customers want exact times!"** Response: "We'll practice giving ranges that feel confident, not vague."
- **"20% seems like too much."** Response: "Let's track your actual vs. estimated times for a week and see."

#### Lesson 3: Professional Communication Scripts (30 minutes)

**Demonstration (10 minutes):**
Facilitator performs both poor and excellent first contact calls using same scenario.

**Poor Example Scripts:**
- "Um, hi, I guess you have some water damage or something?"
- "I'll try to get someone out there, maybe tomorrow?"
- "This sounds pretty bad - you might be out of your house for months."

**Excellent Example:**
- Use provided scripts from training materials
- Demonstrate confident tone, systematic approach, realistic expectations

**Practice Session (15 minutes):**
- Participants practice opening scripts in pairs
- Rotate every 3 minutes: caller, responder, observer
- Observer uses checklist from Resource materials

**Debrief (5 minutes):**
"What felt different between the poor and excellent examples?" Focus on customer confidence levels.

#### Lesson 4: Establishing Next Steps and Timelines (30 minutes)

**Case Study Analysis (10 minutes):**
Present real project scenario (Brisbane townhouse water damage from Resource materials). Groups identify all necessary steps and realistic timelines.

Groups create visual timeline on flip chart paper showing:
- Immediate actions (4 hours)
- Short-term actions (24-48 hours)
- Project planning (Week 1)
- Communication touchpoints

**Gallery Walk (5 minutes):**
Groups post timelines, walk around room, place sticky notes with questions or suggestions on other groups' work.

## Facilitator Troubleshooting Guide

### Common Participant Challenges

#### "I'm Not Good at Scripts - They Sound Fake"
**Response Strategy:**
- Emphasise personalisation while maintaining key elements
- Practice until delivery feels natural
- Share that even experienced actors rehearse scripts
- Focus on confidence building through repetition

#### "Customers Don't Want to Wait for Buffers"
**Response Strategy:**
- Role-play showing how buffers prevent bigger disappointments
- Provide examples of how missed deadlines damage relationships
- Practice confident delivery of realistic timelines
- Emphasise managing expectations vs. making promises

#### "This Feels Like Too Much to Remember"
**Response Strategy:**
- Break down into smaller components
- Focus on SCOPE method as foundation
- Emphasise that mastery comes with practice
- Provide additional coaching opportunities

#### "I've Been Doing This for Years"
**Response Strategy:**
- Acknowledge experience while introducing refinements
- Position as "adding tools to existing expertise"
- Use their experience to help newer participants
- Challenge them with advanced scenarios

### Technical Difficulties

#### Audio Equipment Problems
- **Backup Plan:** Use participants' mobile phones for recordings
- **Alternative:** Facilitator demonstrates all call examples live
- **Test:** Check all equipment 30 minutes before session

#### Insufficient Participants (Less than 4)
- **Adaptation:** More individual coaching, less group work
- **Benefit:** More personalised attention and feedback
- **Approach:** Increase role-play time with facilitator participation

#### Time Management Issues
- **Priority Order:** 1) Core concepts, 2) Essential exercises, 3) Assessment, 4) Advanced practice
- **Time Savers:** Combine exercises 2-3, reduce gallery walk time, streamline action planning
- **Extension Options:** Offer optional follow-up session for advanced practice

### Participant Engagement Strategies

#### Visual Learners
- Use flip charts for all key concepts
- Create timeline diagrams
- Provide written scenarios and checklists

#### Auditory Learners
- Encourage verbal practice and repetition
- Use recorded customer calls if available
- Include group discussions and verbal feedback

#### Kinesthetic Learners
- Maximise role-play and hands-on practice
- Let them handle and complete forms
- Use movement in exercises (gallery walks, etc.)
