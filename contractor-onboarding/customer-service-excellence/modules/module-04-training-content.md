## Introduction (10 minutes)

### The Power of Professional Presentation
In disaster recovery, you often meet customers during their most vulnerable moments - when their homes or businesses have been damaged. Your professional presentation serves as immediate reassurance that they've chosen competent, trustworthy professionals to restore their property. Research shows that customers form judgments about service quality within the first 7 seconds of meeting a service provider.

**Key Insight:** Professional presentation isn't about impressing customers - it's about providing confidence and reassurance during crisis situations.

### The Australian Professional Context
Australian professional standards balance formality with approachability. Customers expect competence and reliability without unnecessary pretension. The "fair dinkum" approach values authenticity, practical expertise, and respectful directness.

**Cultural Balance:**
- Professional competence without arrogance
- Friendly approachability without casual unprofessionalism
- Practical expertise demonstrated through action
- Respect for customer property and circumstances
